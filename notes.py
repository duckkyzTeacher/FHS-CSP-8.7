#Example 1: Basic List Creation and Access
# Create a list of favorite movies
movies = []
# Access and print the first and last movie
print("First movie:", )
print("Last movie:", )

# Print the entire list
print("All movies:", )


#Example 2: Modifying a List (Adding, Removing, and Updating Elements)
# Initial list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape"]

# Add a new fruit to the list
print("After adding mango:", fruits)

# Remove 'orange' from the list
print("After removing orange:", fruits)

# Update 'banana' to 'blueberry'
print("After updating banana to blueberry:", fruits)


#Example 3: List Slicing
# List of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Get the first five numbers
first_five = []
print("First five numbers:", first_five)

# Get the last three numbers
last_three = []
print("Last three numbers:", last_three)

# Get all numbers except the first and last
middle_numbers = []
print("Middle numbers:", middle_numbers)

#Example 4: Sorting a List and Using for Loops
# List of student names
students = ["John", "Emily", "Michael", "Sarah", "David"]

# Sort the list in alphabetical order
print("Sorted student names:", students)

# Print each studentâ€™s name using a for loop
